\section{Introduction}
The UK government has put their efforts into building an aggregated collection of accident records in the England, Scotland and Wales regions
over a span of ten years from 2005 to 2014. Having access to this, one of the most comprehensive data sets on traffic, we work towards
uncovering patterns and answer questions related to the potential causes and trends of accidents.
